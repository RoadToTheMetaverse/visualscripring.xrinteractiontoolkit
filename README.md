Visual Scripting extensions for XR Interaction Toolkit
====

## Warning!
> This **experimental** package is developed by **me**, not Unity. Furthermore, Unity does not support experimental packages and does not guarantee that experimental packages will be fully released and verified to be safe to use in production.

## About this project
As part of the [Road to Metaverse, Creator Series](https://create.unity.com/road-to-metaverse), I am developing a set of extensions to Unity's Visual Scripting that integrate XR Interaction Toolkit features. This project also serves as a learning and documenting exercise to ensure better on-boarding as we start creating XR experiences.

  Check out [this fork](https://github.com/jeromemaurey/XRIT-VS-Extensions-Examples) of the XR Interaction Toolkit Examples that integrates these extensions and contains examples for Visual Scripts re-creating the C# versions in the Demo scene. See release notes below for supported features.
